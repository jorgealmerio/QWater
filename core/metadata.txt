changelog=
    3.1.9 - 2024/04/07
        - Bug fix: QgsVectorLayer.selectByRect(): argument 2 has unexpected type 'bool'
    3.1.8 - 2020/04/09
        - Bug fix: Coordinate transform error with QgsPoint (changed to QgsPointXY)
    3.1.7 - 2019/04/03
        - Better multipart manager: checker and converter
        - Better check duplicated pipe ID
        - Changed flow calculation by Zones to use topology by attribute instead of geometry to avoid accuracy snap issues
    3.1.6 - 2019/01/29 
        - Minor code improvements
        - Increase decimal places to 3 from field Calculated flow on the Settings dialog
        - Refresh labels after get elevation data from raster
        - Make Settings dialog to Stay on top of others windows
    3.1.5 - 2019/01/28 - Improvements
        - New Option: Button to estimate Maximum pipe flow based on: Diameter, Roughness and maximum headloss from pipes tables
        - New tool: Get Elevation from Raster to Nodes
        - New tool: Create/Update 'DN' (or NPS Nominal Pipe Size) field based on Pipes Table from QWater settings. This routine is also automatic called after Economic diameter tool run.
        - Adjust Pipe Style (qml) to use 'DN' field created by the new tool
        - QWater Tools was organized below submenu 'Tools'
        - Created Button menu for QWater like: Get Elevation Tool and for future planned tools
        - Changed Write Epanet INP tool icon
        - Changed Sizing icon color to QWater blue
    3.1.4 - 2019/01/09 - Bug fix: Error creating missing junctions with "Make Model" tool 
    3.1.3 - 2019/01/08 - Bug fix: Error on exporting by "Write Epanet INP file" tool on some situations 
    3.1.2 - 2018/12/20 - Bug fix: Only start and end vertex were exported by "Write Epanet INP file" tool. Now all polyline vertex are exported.
    3.1.1 - 2018/11/06 - Improvement
        - Display of calculated maximum flow for Initial and Final population with a button to copy value to clipboard
        - English Quick User Guide/Tutorial (translated by Neil Falconer). Accessible by link at <Plugin/QWater/About>
        - Portuguese Quick User Guide/Tutorial update. Accessible by link at <Plugin/QWater/About>
        - Added Donate button to metadata
    3.1.0 - 2018/10/31 - Bugs fix
        - Bug on Flow calculation by Hydraulic Zones
    3.0.6 - 2018/10/09 - Improvements
        - Better message when no need to use fill tool
        - When use Calculate Economic Diameter, the Roughness field is now updated too, with the defined values from pipes table of Settings dialog
        - Option to use Hydraulic Zones (Polygon layer) instead of unique population and coefficients data for all model
    3.0.5 - 2018/10/09 - Bugs
        - Qgis LPS sample file update (old version was making a error on QWater settings)
        - Fill in tool now working
        - Bug on running simulation with Pumps
    3.0.4 - 2018/09/18 - Improvements
        - Renumber Network Tool
        - Option to Size pipe diameters only for selected features (features must be selected before run routine)
        - Bug fix on running simulation on Linux (thanks to Juan Ramseyer)
    3.0.3 - 2018/09/18 - Bug
        - Bug with 'DEMAND_PTO' field. The field was beeing written to Epanet inp file causing an error on Running simulation when the field was not null.
    3.0.2 - 2018/09/05 - Improvement and minor bugs
        - Design/Sizing of Pipes now uses the data (Status On/Off, Diameter, Headloss, Roughness) entered in the user table of the Settings Dialog
        - Import and export Pipe data table (Hint: make a export to see the text file format)
    3.0.1 - 2018/07/21 - Bug fixs and improvements:
        - Option to unset QWater layer from settings dialog
        - New Project option bug
        - Load Styles bug
        - Minimum description and instruction web page created and accessible from About menu
        - Better LPS sample project (by Juan Ramseyer)
        - Minor improvements
    3.0.0 - 2018/04/09 - Update to Qgis 3.0
    1.0.0 - 2016/07/19 - Initial Release

about=QWater is a plugin based on GHydraulics Plugin from <a href="mailto:sdteffen@sdteffen.de">Steffen Macke</a>. It allows to design and analyze water supply networks using EPANET (no need to install). It allows to write EPANET INP files as well as running an EPANET simulation from QGIS complete with loading the result data. QWater contains a function to calculate economic diameters based on given diameters and maximum friction headloss. The functions are accessible from the Qgis plugin menu and toolbars.
